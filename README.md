## Description
I needed a small project to learn about SMT PCB design so this small game controller was the perfect project. I had to create my own Arduino Pro Micro with Surface mount components and was really happy that everything worked first time!

It is based on the Arduino Pro Micro by Sparkfun. I modified the original Eagle files to make a bigger board with space for all the SMT components and then ordered the half-done boards from JLCPCB. 

Then in-house I soldered the THT components like potentiometers, buttons, etc, and burned an arduino bootloader into the fresh 32U4 chips. Then thy can be programmed by the Arduino IDE.

Also created custom cases and 3D printed them. Finished plug and play units are available on my website.

## Features
* Plug and play game controller 
* Based on the Arduino Pro Micro (pins available for expansion and modification)
* Uses Joystick library, acts as a windows/mac default game controller
* 2 big linear potentiometers
* 1 small linear potentiometer
* 1 rotary potentiometer
* 1 latching switch
* 3 temporary switches
* 1 reset switch
* Usb interface
